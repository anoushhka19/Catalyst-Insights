Catalyst Insights

Python, PyTorch, ASE, SQLAlchemy, Flask

Developed a machine learningâ€“driven platform for predicting
relaxedadsorption energies of catalytic materials, reducing the need
forcomputationally expensive DFT simulations. Implemented IS2RE
(InitialStructure to Relaxed Energy) models to enable highthroughputscreening
of catalysts. Integrated tools like ASE for
atomic structuremanipulation and PyTorch for model inference.
Designed a Flask-based web application with modules for material
input preprocessing,ML-based energy prediction, result visualization,
and comparativeanalysis. This project significantly accelerates the
catalyst discoveryprocess and demonstrates the effective fusion of
AI andcomputational chemistry.
